# Self-Evaluation

- WThis final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?

This was week has been very difficult, but also very rewarding. It felt shitty to encounter this amount of challenge, but the overcoming it feels good.

My workflow is bad, I need to take time to eat food. 

I want to remember the correct syntax for using arrays found in objects because i have a feeling it may come up again.
